I don't always reply to emails, particularly if the reply would be just one line and more so if I expect to see or speak to you in person. Why? There's a few reasons:
1. email is a terrible format for conversational communication, especially when there's multiple people involved. Every reply adds another layer of information on top of the original idea. If multiple people reply, the message thread can become a message tree and it's easy to lose track of the central discussion. Instead of typing the words "thanks for your email" I'd much rather wait til I see you and say it out loud. 
2. email is heavy. Compared to chat messages, email messages typically include more bytes of header and footer information than actual message. When I reply to an email, all those extra bytes are duplicated, resent and stored again in both our profiles. Network and storage requirements for emails grow exponentially with each reply (and this is even worse if you 'reply all'). Sometimes when I do reply to an email, I remove people from the CC list or delete some of the older content if it seems no longer relevant.
3. sometimes I just forget (sorry!)
In any case, if you have sent me an email - thank you! If I haven't yet replied, I still might. If not I hope we get a chance to speak soon and I will (probably) thank you in person.
